# What do you want to learn about R?


# Here is what we will do today


## Analyse and clean up a data file 
```{r eval=FALSE}
ed_data_link <- "http://data.gov.au/dataset/6bfec5ea-207e-4d67-8965-c7e72290844b/resource/33d84954-b13a-4f4e-afb9-6468e287fa3c/download/govhack3.csv";

## Clean up the column names
library(tidyverse)

facilities <- 
  read_csv(ed_data_link, col_names = FALSE, n_max = 1) %>% 
  gather(key, value) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(value)) %>%  
  .$value

column_names <- 
  read_csv(ed_data_link, n_max = 1) %>% 
  gather(key, value) %>% 
  .$value %>% 
  make.unique

column_names[2:8] <- str_c(column_names[2:8], '0', sep='.')
```

## Import data into R
```{r eval=FALSE}
daily_attendance <- 
  read_csv(ed_data_link, skip = 2, col_names = column_names) %>% 
  gather(index, value, -Date) %>% 
  separate(index, 
           into = c("index", "facility_id"), 
           sep="\\.", 
           remove=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(facility_id = as.numeric(facility_id) + 1) %>% 
  mutate(facility_name = facilities[facility_id]) %>% 
  select(Date, facility_name, index, value)
```

## Export R data to a file
```{r eval=FALSE}
daily_attendance %>%
  write_csv(path = "Perth_ED_daily_attendance_2013_2014.csv")
```



## Deal with missing values
```{r eval=FALSE}
daily_attendance <- 
  daily_attendance %>% 
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) %>% 
  replace_na(replace = list(value = 0)) 

```


## Convert data types
```{r eval=FALSE}
## Processing date time
library(lubridate)
daily_attendance <- 
  daily_attendance %>% 
  mutate(Date = dmy(Date))
```

## Interact with data in R
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
daily_attendance <- read_csv("Perth_ED_daily_attendance_2013_2014.csv")

library(DT)
daily_attendance %>% head %>% 
  datatable
```

## Graphical display of data
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=TRUE, warning=FALSE}
library(lubridate)

daily_attendance <- read_csv("Perth_ED_daily_attendance_2013_2014.csv")

daily_attendance %>% 
  mutate(Date = dmy(Date)) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(mapping = aes(x = Date, y = Attendance, col = facility_name))
```

## Fitting statistical models on data
```{r echo=FALSE, eval=TRUE}
daily_attendance %>% 
  filter(!facility_name %in% c(
    "Swan District Hospital",
    "King Edward Memorial Hospital For Women",
    "Rockingham General Hospital")) %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Attendance, y = Admissions)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "firebrick") +
  facet_wrap(~facility_name)
```

<p class="note">Now create a project and creat a new R script inside the project.</p>


# R basics

## Tidy R

There are many ways to program R.


We will follow the tidy way:

* RStudio
* tidyverse



## Loading R packages

```{r eval=TRUE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

# Import the data into R

## R can handle many, many data formats

R can read data from:

* Files (csv, Excel, SAS, SPSS, Stata, ...)
* Database (MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL, ODBC, ...)

<p class="note">See a complete list at https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-data.html</p>

## Introducing the ED dataset
<p>
<img src="images/ed_data.png" height="300vh">
</p>




<p class="note">https://data.gov.au/dataset/emergency-department-admissisons-and-attendances/resource/33d84954-b13a-4f4e-afb9-6468e287fa3c</p>

## The data location
```{r}
ed_data_link <- 
  "http://data.gov.au/dataset/6bfec5ea-207e-4d67-8965-c7e72290844b/resource/33d84954-b13a-4f4e-afb9-6468e287fa3c/download/govhack3.csv";
```

or 
```{r}
ed_data_link <- 
  "http://bit.ly/2nkCUEh"
```



<p class="note"> `<-` is the R symbol for variable assignment; You may use `=` too.</p>

## Read CSV file

Tidyverse function `read_csv`
```{r warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
daily_attendance <- read_csv(ed_data_link, skip = 1)
```

## Read CSV file
Try to read in the weather data in the `nycflights` dataset from https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/nycflights13/master/data-raw/weather.csv

or

http://bit.ly/2E0Y1o9

## Read CSV file
```{r}
weather <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadley/nycflights13/master/data-raw/weather.csv") 
```

or 
```{r}
weather <- read_csv("http://bit.ly/2E0Y1o9") 
```

## Read CSV file
What if you only want the first row?
```{r eval=FALSE}
top_row <- read_csv(ed_data_link, col_names = FALSE, n_max = 1)
```
How about the second row?
```{r eval=FALSE}
second_row <- read_csv(ed_data_link, n_max = 1)
```

## Your turn

<p class="note"> `Find a data set that you know. Load it into R. </p>

## Summary

To read a CSV file, use `read_csv`. 

You can control:

* Where is the header?
* How many rows to read?

# Display data

## Display data with datatable
```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(daily_attendance)
```


## Display data with datatable
```{r}
library(DT)
datatable(daily_attendance)
```

<p class="note"> Display your data using datatable. Can you use the sorting and search functions to interrogate the data? </p>

#Data Transformation

## Cleaning up column names

Let's also clean up the column names.
```{r eval=FALSE}
column_names <- second_row %>% 
  unlist(., use.names=FALSE) %>% 
  make.unique

column_names[2:8] <- str_c(column_names[2:8], '0', sep='.')
```

<p class="note">pipe: `%>%` is a tidyverse operator to apply a sequence of operations</p>

## Cleaning up column names
This allows us to read the data with more readable column names.
```{r eval=FALSE}
daily_attendance <- 
  read_csv(ed_data_link, skip = 2, col_names = column_names)
``` 

## Your turn

Do you have any columns in your data set that needs to be renamed?

## Tidy data (the ideal)

<img src="images/tidy-1.png" width="50%">

From Hadley

> 1. Each variable must have its own column.
> 2. Each observation must have its own row.
> 3. Each value must have its own cell.




## Tidy data

Check the following data tables from tidyverse and see which ones are untidy.

```{r eval=FALSE}
library(DT)
datatable(table1)
datatable(table2)
datatable(table4a)
```

## Tidy data

<p class="note">Is our ED dataset tidy?</p>

## Your turn

Is your data set tidy?

- What are the variables?
- What is an observation?
- Do you have values in the heading?
- Do you have variables names in a column?


## Gather and spread to tidy data
<div class="double">
<p class="double-flow">
gather

<img src="images/tidy-9.png" width="150%">
</p>
<p class="double-flow">
spread

<img src="images/tidy-8.png" width="110%">
</p>
</div>




## Gather and spread to tidy data

Our ED data is untidy. We will tidy it up in two steps: first gather; then spread.

Gather:
```{r eval=FALSE}
daily_attendance <- daily_attendance %>% 
  gather(key = index, value = value, -Date) 
```

## Gather and spread to tidy data
This step allows us to process similar variable names.
```{r eval=FALSE}
facilities <- top_row %>% 
  unlist(., use.names=FALSE) %>% 
  na.omit()

daily_attendance <- daily_attendance %>% 
  separate(index, into = c("index", "facility_id"), sep="\\.", remove=TRUE) %>% 
  mutate(facility_id = as.numeric(facility_id) + 1) %>% 
  mutate(facility_name = facilities[facility_id]) %>% 
  select(Date, facility_name, index, value)
```




## Gather and spread to tidy data
Before we apply spread again, let's deal with the missing values.
```{r eval=FALSE}
## Replacing N/A with 0
daily_attendance <- daily_attendance %>% 
  mutate(value = as.numeric(value)) %>% 
  replace_na(replace = list(value = 0)) 
```

## Gather and spread to tidy data
Now we use spread to separate out the different types of counts.
```{r eval=FALSE}
daily_attendance <- daily_attendance %>% 
  spread(index, value)
```


## Your turn

If your data is untidy, use spread and gather to tidy it up.

## Summary

You should prepare tidy data for analysis.

The key is to 
 
* put data from the same measurement source in a column
* put each observation in a row

Use gather and spread to obtain tidy data




# Export data from R

## Write csv file

Let's save the tidy data.

You can use the `write_csv` function.
```{r}
write_csv(daily_attendance, 
          path = "Perth_ED_daily_attendance_2013_2014.csv")
```

## Your turn

Write your processed data into a CSV file.

# Data preparation for analysis




## Data types


```{r eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
daily_attendance <- read_csv("Perth_ED_daily_attendance_2013_2014.csv")
```

If you view the dataset in R, you can see that each column has a type.
```{r eval=TRUE}
daily_attendance %>% select(1:4)
```

## Your turn

Examine the data types in your data set. Are they all appropriate?

## Suitable data types 

Suppose that you now have a tidy data set. 

All columns (variables) should have the right data types before analysis.

You can use the following conversion functions:

* For continuous data: `as.numeric` 
* For categorical data: `as.factor`
* For strings: `as.character`

## Use mutate function to organise the data type conversion

```{r}
daily_attendance <- 
  daily_attendance %>% 
  mutate(Tri_1_1 = as.numeric(Tri_1_1),
         Attendance = as.numeric(Attendance))
```

## Your turn

Use `mutate` to fix the data types in your data set.

## Date and time

Dates and times should be treated differently. 

Identify the data type for `time_hour` in the `weather` data.
```{r}
weather 
```

<p class = "note">Does the `Date` column in daily_attendance has a suitable data type?</p> 

## Use the `lubridate` package

The `lubridate` package has many parsing functions for date and time data.

The function `dmy` is used here.
```{r}
library(lubridate)

daily_attendance <- daily_attendance %>% 
  mutate(Date = dmy(Date))
```

## Derive additional variables from dates

From dates, we often need to derive other information, such as the day of the week.
```{r}
start_date <- daily_attendance$Date[1]

wday(start_date)

wday(start_date, label = TRUE)
```

<p class="note">On which day should a week start?<p> 

## Quarter 

You can get the quarter of the year.
```{r}
quarter(start_date)

quarter(start_date, with_year = TRUE)
```

## Quarter and Australian financial year
In Australia, we may want the financial year to start from July. 
```{r}
quarter(start_date, with_year = TRUE, fiscal_start = 7)
```

## Your turn

Process the date or time variables in your data set. 

## Summary

Use `lubridate` to parse strings representing dates and times.


## Taking subsets

<img src="images/filter_select.PNG" width = "110%">

We use `filter` to choose rows and `select` to choose columns.

<p class="note">Can you select only the daily admission data for Fremantle Hospital?</p>


## Taking subsets
```{r}
daily_attendance %>% 
  filter(facility_name == "Fremantle Hospital") %>% 
  select(Date, Admissions) %>% 
  arrange(Date)
```
<p class="note">Here, we also sort the results chronologically using the `arrange` function.</p>

## Your turn

Use `filter` and `select` to reduce your data set, keeping only the most interesting parts.


## Summary

#### Use `filter` to select the target subset (like `where` in SQL)

#### Use `select` to keep only the relevant variables

# Simple analytics

## Summarise data using simple statistics

With `summarise`, we can compute simple statistics on individual columns. 
```{r}
daily_attendance %>% 
  summarise(peak_admission = max(Admissions),
            avg_admission = mean(Admissions),
            bottom_admission = min(Admissions))
```

<p class="note">Can you get the average number of daily attendances?</p>

## Summarise data using simple statistics
```{r}
daily_attendance %>% 
  summarise(avg_attendance = mean(Attendance))
```


## Summarise data using simple statistics
We can compute the statics for many columns.
```{r}
daily_attendance %>% 
  summarise_at(vars("Tri_1",         
                    "Tri_2",
                    "Tri_3",
                    "Tri_4",
                    "Tri_5"),
               funs( 
                 peak = max,
                 avg = mean,
                 bottom = min))
```

## Your turn

Use `summarise` and `summarise_at` to generate some overall statistics in your dataset.

## Summarise data by goups
Of course such statistics are not very useful if no comparison happens.
```{r}
daily_attendance %>% 
  group_by(facility_name) %>% 
  summarise(avg_tri_1 = mean(Tri_1)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(avg_tri_1))
```
<p class="note">Here, I sort the result from large to small as I want to know which hospitals get severe cases.</p>

## Your turn

Use `group_by` together with `summarise` and `arrange` to compare across groups.

## Summary

Use `summarise` to generate summary statistics.

Use it with `group_by` to allow for comparison.

<p class="note">We will soon see how such comparison can be understood with graphics.</p>

# Simple visualisations

## Why do we need plots?

Plots can show:

1. Variation within a variable
2. Relationship among variables

## Common types of plots 

For variation (distribution)

* bar chart (categorical data)
* histogram (continuous data)
* box plot (continuous data)
* Quantile-Quantile plot (continuous data)

## Common types of plots 

For relationship

* point plot (two continuous variables)
* line plot (continuous vs time)



## ggplot2

Three elements of a data plot.

1. a dataset 
2. a geom function (`geom_*`)
3. a collection of mappings (`aes`)

```{r}
ggplot(data = mpg) + 
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x = displ, y = hwy))
```

## ggplot2

In general, we have the following template.
```
ggplot(data = <DATA>) + 
  <GEOM_FUNCTION>(mapping = aes(<MAPPINGS>))
```

<img src="images/geom_mapping.png" width="80%">

## ggplot2

The `<GEOM_FUNCTION>` is determined by the plot type:

* `geom_bar`
* `geom_histogram`
* `geom_boxplot`
* `geom_point`
* `geom_line`

The `<MAPPINGS>` binds data columns with graphical elements of the `<GEOM_FUNCTION>`.

## ggplot2

Let's generate some plots to understand the ED attendance data from Royal Perth Hospital.
```{r}
rph_attendance <- daily_attendance %>% 
  filter(facility_name == "Royal Perth Hospital") %>% 
  select(-facility_name)
```

## ggplot2


Let's look at the distribution of Admissions.
```{r}
rph_attendance %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x = Admissions))
```

<p class = "note">Do you see any outliers?</p>

## Your turn
Go to your dataset. 

- If it has a continuous variable, generate a histogram.
- If it has a categorical variable, generate a barplot.

## ggplot2

The numbers form several time series.
```{r}
rph_attendance %>% 
  ggplot() + geom_line(mapping = 
                         aes(x = Date,
                             y = Admissions))
```
<p class="note">Do you see where the outlier come from?</p>


## Your turn

Can you plot a time series from your data?

## ggplot2

If you like to check if the dip in admissions happened to other hospitals, you can plots two time series together. 
```{r}
daily_attendance %>% 
  filter(facility_name %in% c("Royal Perth Hospital", 
                              "Fremantle Hospital")) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(x = Date, 
                  y = Admissions, 
                  col = facility_name))
```

<p class="note">Can you compare the daily attendance numbers between Royal Perth Hospital and Fremantle Hospital?</p>


## gpplot2 
```{r}
daily_attendance %>% 
  filter(facility_name %in% c("Royal Perth Hospital", 
                              "Fremantle Hospital")) %>% 
  ggplot() + 
  geom_line(
    mapping = aes(x = Date, 
                  y = Attendance, 
                  col = facility_name))
```


## Your turn

With your data, can you plot multiple time series at the same time for comparison?

## Summary


The suitable plot type depends on both the question and the variable data types.

Tidy data makes plotting easy.

# Simple statistical models




## Fitting statistical models

R is probably the best language for fitting statistical models.
```{r}
adm_fit <- lm(formula = Admissions ~ Attendance, 
              data = daily_attendance)

library(broom)
tidy(adm_fit) 
```


## Showing the fit 

We can use `geom_smooth` to plot the fitted regression model together with the data.
```{r}
daily_attendance %>% 
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = Attendance, y = Admissions)) + 
  geom_point(alpha = 0.1) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "firebrick") +
  facet_wrap(~facility_name)
```

```{r}
3+5
```


## Your turn

Generate a scatter plot if your data has two continuous variables that may be causally related. 

Use `geom_smooth` to add a regression model over the plot.

## Summary

### R provides many model fitting functions

### `geom_smooth` can allow fitting models displayed with the data
